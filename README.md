# Chest-Xray-image-classifier
This deep learning model employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze chest X-ray images for the accurate prediction of pneumonia presence. The model leverages advanced image processing techniques to distinguish between healthy lungs and those affected by pneumonia.
